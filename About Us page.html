  <h2>About Us </h2> 
  <p>Voice India development trust established in 2002, the VIDT Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to transforming the lives of vulnerable communities in southern Tamil Nadu. In 2021, recognizing the urgent need for elderly care, we founded the Arram Old Age Home in Kanyakumari district. Here, we provide a safe haven for over 25 elderly individuals who lack family support, offering them not only shelter and nourishment but also medical attention and emotional care.</p>

  <p>Recognizing the growing need for institutional care for abandoned elderly individuals, especially those without family support, VIDT Foundation stepped in to address this pressing issue. Our government-approved facility is designed to accommodate up to 50 elderly residents, providing not just food and shelter, but also access to medical care, emotional counseling, and a safe environment where they can find peace and companionship.</p>

   <p>Currently, we provide care and support for 25 elderly residents, with both short-term and long-term care options.</p>
